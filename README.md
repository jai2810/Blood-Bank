# Blood-Bank
Blood bank is a web application that emulates the working of a blood bank.

This is a complete backend part of the application that deals with real time data inserted and deleted to the database.

Use this to connect with frontend, via calling the api that this code offers.

To know more about the apis download this code, and run it in your preferred IDE for java and springboot,
like Intellij IDEA, ecllipse, Netbeans, Spring tool suite etc.

To run this application, just run BankApplication.java, then goto http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and test the apis with real time data.

Feel free to ping me if you find a bug, or just create a PR :)
