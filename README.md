# Blood-Bank
Blood bank is a web application that emulates the working of a blood bank.

This is a complete backend part of the application that deals with real time data that is inserted and deleted directly into the database via APIs.

To know more about the apis this application offers, download the code and run it in your preferred IDE for java.
Like Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, Netbeans, Spring tool suite etc.

Note : Since this is locally hosted you have to add data to it via apis. And the database will be created automatically into your local machine.
Use Robo 3T to check more on database created and play with it.

This can also be used to connect with frontend, via calling the apis that the code offers.

To run this application, just run BankApplication.java, then goto http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and test the apis with real time data.

Database used : NOSQL(MongoDB)

Programming languages : JAVA

Frameworks used : Spring, SpringBoot
